<h3>Our goal is to create the first free, comprehensive, standardized, linked set of election data for the United States, including federal and statewide offices.</h3>
<p>No freely available comprehensive source of official election results exists. The current options for election data can be difficult to find and use or financially out-of-reach for most journalists and civic hackers. We want the people who work with election data to be able to get what they need, whether that’s a CSV file for stories and data analysis or JSON usable for web applications and interactive graphics.</p>
<p>OpenElections is generously supported by the <a href="http://www.knightfoundation.org/press-room/press-release/six-ventures-bring-data-public-winners-knight-news/">John S. and James L. Knight Foundation’s Knight News Challenge</a>.</p>
