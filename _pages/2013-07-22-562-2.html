<p>Gathering information about election results in the 50 states can be tricky business. There are at least 50 different ways states collect and put out this data - and probably more.</p>
<p>Working on a few Western states makes me love Idaho, where spreadsheets with results for every county by precinct are available <a href="http://www.sos.idaho.gov/elect/results.htm" target="_blank">back to 1990</a>.</p>
<p>Go Idaho!</p>
<p>But in almost every instance, it pays to reach out and ask questions. A quick phone call to <a href="http://www.fec.gov/pubrec/cfsdd/cfsdd.shtml" target="_blank">state board of elections staffers</a> usually gets a suggestion to send an email with those questions. In Idaho, for instance, we needed details about primaries. The state first had a closed primary just last year, and we needed verification that all primaries back to 2000 were open.</p>
<p>In other instances, it's worth contacting the state board of elections and seeking out the information behind the PDFs that so many states are seeking. I've used the <a href="http://docs.openelections.net/data-interview/">list of questions</a> Serdar Tumgoren put together.</p>
<p>Consider <a href="http://soswy.state.wy.us/Elections/ElectionResults.aspx" target="_blank">Wyoming</a>, where Excel results are available for 2010 and 2012 but the other years are PDFs.</p>
<p>When asked what software they used to compile results, Wyoming officials replied, "Excel." When asked if they'd make Excel files available, this was the initial response: <strong>"No, Our office has a policy to offer the results in PDF format on-line only."</strong></p>
<p>Time for a <a href="http://docs.openelections.net/foia-request/" target="_blank">public records request</a>?</p>
<p>So I headed over to the <a href="http://www.rcfp.org/foia" target="_blank">automatic letter</a> generator offered by the Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press. Like Idaho, it rocks! I wrote the letter, downloaded, and pasted it in an email to my contact in Wyoming on June 29. They replied July 8.</p>
<div>
<p>On July 12, they emailed me the zipped files.</p>
<p>Hooray, public records requests!</p>
<p>There are a few hangups - the 2006 files are corrupt, so the PDF files will have to do. And the 2000 files were made with QuatroPro, a spreadsheet program you youngsters won't be familiar with. But I suspect a little googling will turn up a conversion answer. So I'm well on my way!</p>
<p>Happy metadata (and data) gathering!</p>
